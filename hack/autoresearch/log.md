# Autoresearch experiment log

The running record of autoresearch experiments. The agent appends one entry per
experiment (kept or discarded) following the format in
[`program.md`](program.md). Autoresearch experiments do not get ADRs; this log
is the record of what was tried and why.

Each entry looks like:

```markdown
## <n>. <short title> - KEPT | DISCARDED
- Hypothesis: <what you expected and why>
- Change: <files / approach>
- Correctness: fast gate <pass/fail>, judge <approved/rejected[: reason]>
- Primary: <best> -> <new> (<+/-%>)
- Secondary: alloc <..>, ns <..>, cpu <..>, mutexWait <..>
- Outcome & why: <why kept or discarded; what was learned>
- Commit: <hash if kept>
```
